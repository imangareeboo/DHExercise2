I actually really enjoy messing with HTML pages, even though it can be annoying when it doesn't work just because you left one little sign off. However, I think it was instructive to have an exercise in class like this. I will say that prepping for this exercise left me going like this ðŸ˜© ðŸ˜± ðŸ˜§ ðŸ˜µ

However, now that I'm done, I can happily express myself this way ðŸ˜¤ ðŸ˜¤ ðŸ˜¤ ðŸ˜† ðŸ˜† ðŸ˜†

## Comments or notes about problems
